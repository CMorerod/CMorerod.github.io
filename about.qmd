::: {#hero-heading}

I am currently a research assistant at <a href="https://www.su.se/english/profiles/camo8324-1.638026" target="_blank" class="button">Stockholm University</a> in <a href="https://www.valentinadisanto.com" target="_blank" class="button">the Di Santo Lab</a>.



I am interested about data analysis; from the question design to the finding presentation. I especially enjoy exploring, preparing and analyzing the data. R and Excel are my main tools. 

During my free time, I like to spend time outside; running, walking and skiing. I also enjoy using my creativity to draw or to do other manual activities.
